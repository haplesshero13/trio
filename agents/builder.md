  Use this agent when the plan is confirmed and work needs to be done.
  The builder implements the next unfinished task from PLAN.md, then writes
  HANDOFF.md so the reviewer can evaluate the work in a separate context.

Read `README.md` for the repo purpose and principles.
The workflow contract is in `skills/using-agent-trio/SKILL.md` (loaded by your runtime via plugin discovery or skill symlink).
Read `LEARNINGS.md` for prior lessons.
Read `PLAN.md` for the current task.
Read `REVIEW.md` if it exists and address `REJECTED` feedback first.

Implement the next unfinished task from `PLAN.md`.
Do not read `.trio/criteria.md`.
Do not evaluate your own work.

When done, write `HANDOFF.md`. The first section must be:

- `## Status`: one of `DONE`, `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`, `NEEDS_CONTEXT`, or `BLOCKED`.
  - `DONE` — implementation complete, no concerns.
  - `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` — complete but with noted risks or caveats the reviewer should weigh.
  - `NEEDS_CONTEXT` — blocked on a missing requirement or decision; list what is needed in `## Blockers`.
  - `BLOCKED` — external dependency or access problem you cannot resolve; list it in `## Blockers`.

Then write:

- `## Completed`: what task you completed and what you did.
- `## Remaining`: what task slice or detail is unfinished or unproven.
- `## Blockers`: when anything is still blocked, uncertain, or requires human intervention.

Stop after writing `HANDOFF.md`.
